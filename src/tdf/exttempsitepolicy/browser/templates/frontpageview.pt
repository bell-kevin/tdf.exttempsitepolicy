        LibreOffice offers a wide variety of features, and when you look for additional functionality,
        there may well be extensions and templates that add that! This site offers a wide range of
        extensions and templates to satisfy your needs. What's more, people, maybe you, can develop
        more extensions and offer them for the collecting on this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Extensions</h2>
    <p>LibreOffice Extensions are tools that can be added or removed independently from your
        installation of the main program. Extensions may add new functionality to your copy
        of LibreOffice, or may make existing functionality easier to use.
    </p>


    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <p>LibreOffice Templates offer you a way to avoid duplicating repetitive actions when creating new
        text documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. They also offer a way to maintain consistency
        of document layout and standard content, and may, for example, be used to maintain consistent
        branding elements when used in a work place.
    </p>
    <p>LibreOffice remains committed to providing users with quality software authored under
        <a class="external-link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software licenses</a>,
        and, as such, our catalogue of extensions and templates are published under
        <a class="external-link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software licenses</a>.
